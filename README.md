## Features

- Add, edit, and delete expenses
- Categorize expenses for better tracking
- Visualize spending patterns with charts and summaries
- User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit
- Fast and scalable backend powered by FastAPI
- RESTful API for integration and extensibility

---

## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture:

```
[User] <---> [Streamlit Frontend] <--HTTP--> [FastAPI Backend] <---> [Database]
```

- **Frontend**: Built using Streamlit, provides interactive forms, dashboards, and visualizations for expense management.
- **Backend**: Built using FastAPI, exposes RESTful API endpoints for expense operations, user management, and reporting.
- **Database**: Stores users, expenses, categories, etc. (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- **Backend**: [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- **Database**: SQLite (default, can be configured)
- **Others**: SQLAlchemy (ORM), Pydantic (data validation), Matplotlib/Plotly (visualizations)

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rupeshkumarp/Expenses-Management.git
    cd Expenses-Management
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Application

**1. Start the FastAPI backend:**
```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```
> This will start the backend API at `http://localhost:8000`.

**2. Start the Streamlit frontend:**
```bash
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```
> This will open the frontend at `http://localhost:8501`.

---

## Usage

- Open the Streamlit app in your browser.
- Register or log in (if user authentication is implemented).
- Add, edit, or delete your expenses.
- Filter expenses by date, category, or amount.
- Generate reports and visualize expense trends.

## API Endpoints

Example endpoints (assuming default FastAPI implementation):

| Method | Endpoint           | Description                 |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| GET    | `/expenses/`       | List all expenses           |
| POST   | `/expenses/`       | Add a new expense           |
| PUT    | `/expenses/{id}`   | Update an expense           |
| DELETE | `/expenses/{id}`   | Delete an expense           |
| GET    | `/categories/`     | List all categories         |
| POST   | `/categories/`     | Add a new category          |
| ...    | ...                | ...                         |

> For detailed API documentation, visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` when the backend is running.
